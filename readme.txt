Instantly verify millions of academic users and provide them with a discount for products on your store.

== Description ==

The User Verification and Discounts plugin is a powerful tool that enables merchants to offer discounts to students and other academic users on their WooCommerce powered WordPress stores.

With this plugin, merchants can easily set up discounts either by product category or for an entire shopping cart, making it a versatile solution for academic discounts. 

Students are sent through a quick and automated verification process and then returned to the shopping cart with applicable discounts already applied. 

Whether you run an online store selling educational materials or any other products that students love, this plugin will help you attract and retain student customers.

== Features ==

* Discounts by Product Category: Specify discounted product categories, and the plugin will apply a discount to all products in those categories after a user verifies their academic status.
* Discount for the Entire Cart: Specify a discount for the entire cart, making it convenient to offer cart-level discounts for academic users.
* Flexible Discount Options: Merchants can choose between a fixed discount or a percentage-based discount, depending on their pricing strategy and business model.
* Easy Configuration: The plugin is easy to configure with an intuitive settings page. Merchants can quickly set up and manage their academic discounts without any technical expertise.
* Friction Free User Experience: Integration with WooCommerce allows discounts to be automatically applied to a user’s cart. Users do not need to retrieve and apply coupon codes. 
* Multiple Languages Supported: The verification process is localized in 8 languages: English, Spanish, Italian, French, German, Korean, Japanese, and Chinese.
